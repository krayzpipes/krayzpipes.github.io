        <h2>The Back Story</h2>
<p>"Logging alert - Microsoft Cloud Logs" was the subject of an email that slid into my inbox one morning.
The alert content said that we had not received Microsoft O365 logs for over an hour. Given that the company
in question consisted of thousands of users, that did not seem right.</p>
<h3>Finding the cause</h3>
<p>I jumped onto the server which hosted a script I had written to pull down Microsoft O365 logs. The
server was pegged. I ran a quick <code>ps -aux</code> and there was a legion of processes associated with the
O365 Python script. It appeared that the python script was unable to finish before the next cron job was
scheduled to kick it off again.</p>
<p>As I thought about how to tackle this problem, I came to the conclusion that my script
just wasn't fast enough. Logs were being generated faster than I could pull them down.</p>
<p>A summary of the process in pulling down logs via the Microsoft O365 Management API:
1. You can pull down logs for multiple log types (Exchange, Azure AD, SharePoint, etc.)
2. For each log type, the API will give you a list of all the various URLs/endpoints that contain the logs in
the time frame you specify.
3. You have to go to each of those endpoints and pull down the logs that reside there. Sometimes tens, hundreds,
or thousands.</p>
<p>If you have a company with thousands of users, this process pumps a lot of HTTP requests to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Python (or at least CPython) is designed to be single-threaded. In the case of our O365 logs, it means that
when I make an API call to 1 of 500 URLs where my logs reside (step 3 above), I have to wait until I get a
response before I can reach out to the second URL. In other words, each call to the API is
'blocking' the rest of the script from executing.</p>
<h3>Out with the old, in with the new</h3>
<p>After some research and recommendations from a couple guys in a local developer's guild,
I came to the conclusion that I needed to learn how to program for concurrency in Python. This means
I can query all these endpoints at virtually the same time. So my time constraint would change from the
sum of all the API queries to the the longest running API query (in most cases).</p>
<p>I eventually got it working. After rewriting the script to use a combination of <code>asyncio</code> and
<code>aiohttp</code>, I was able to pull down roughly thirteen hours worth of logs in twenty seconds.
Using the original script and the <code>requests</code> library, it took twenty minutes to pull down the logs from
the same time frame.</p>
<p>Although I finally got the script working with concurrency built-in, I had a difficult time changing
from a single-threaded mindset to an asynchronous mindset in Python. In addition, it was a whole new
set of terms and libraries to learn. It made me tweak the way I thought about programming in Python.</p>
<p>Knowing the learning curve involved with understanding and changing your programming to suit concurrency,
I will share in this post how I model concurrency programming mentally in hopes it will help someone else
side-step the learning curve.</p>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>I don't want to re-invent the wheel here so I'm including a few links that you should read if you feel like
you're missing part of the picture with what I write:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">Real Python: Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://realpython.com/python-gil/">Real Python: What is the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Some things to keep in mind as you read on:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The O365 script is I/O bound. So it will be doing quite a bit of waiting for responses. This makes it
a perfect candidate for using concurrency in python.</li>
<li>My writing and examples assume you are using <code>asyncio</code> in Python 3.7+. The keywords
that <code>asyncio</code> uses in my examples were not introduced until Python 3.5 (<code>async</code> and
<code>await</code>). Also, there are some great features introduced in Python 3.7 that abstract some of
the low-level functionality like event loops. I recommend using Python 3.7 if at all possible.</li>
<li>Some of my examples and portions of my 'mental model' are not designed for atomic accuracy. They are
designed so that you can quickly make programming decisions by having a fundamental model to use
as you think about programming for concurrency with Python.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Futures</h3>
<p>A future is the promise of a return value. If I'm sending an HTTP GET to a REST API, then a Future would be the
response from that API. This 'promise' could be an actual object,
a notification that a set of instructions has completed execution, an exception, etc.</p>
<h3>Coroutines</h3>
<p>A coroutine is a set of instructions created using the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords. <code>async</code>
let's the interpreter know that the instructions are a coroutine function while <code>await</code>
means, "I'm going to be waiting on some sort of Future (aka response); Therefore, this is a good place
in my instructions to let someone else have a turn."</p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>I think of a task as doing three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runs a coroutine in an event loop.</li>
<li>Knows when he should pass control back to the event loop so someone else can have a turn (sees the <code>await</code>
in his coroutine's instructions)</li>
<li>When it's his turn in the event loop, knows whether his future has returned or whether he is still waiting
and should skip his turn.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Event Loops</h3>
<p>I think of an event loop like a <code>queue</code> full of tasks. Tasks jump in the queue and the event loop will
iterate through the tasks one by one. If a task is ready to execute instructions, the event loop will hand
that task control. If a task is not ready to execute instructions, the event loop will move on to the next
task. This happens over and over until all tasks have completed.</p>
<p>The beauty of an event loop is that you as a programmed just have to give it a task which is created from a
coroutine. The event loop does all the scheduling and management for you.</p>
<h2>Working with the concepts</h2>
<p>Good news about <code>asyncio</code> and Python 3.5+ is that you probably won't have to deal with
Futures directly. In many cases, you won't even have to deal with Tasks directly.</p>
<p>In Python 3.7, <code>asyncio</code> introduced <code>asyncio.get_running_loop()</code>. This means that you don't have to
pass your loop context throughout yoru code! And in the instances that I have used <code>asyncio</code> in Python 3.7,
I don't have to directly interact with the event loop either.</p>
<p>Most cases you will only be required to write a coroutine, and then run that coroutine. The <code>asyncio</code> library
will handle all the details with futures, tasks, and event loops. I'll give a few examples below.</p>
<p>It's still good to have a quick mental model for the concepts that are written about above. The mental models
are especially handy if you have to perform any troubleshooting or in-depth/low-level programming for
concurrency with <code>asyncio</code>.</p>
<h3>Writing a coroutine</h3>
<p>There were two things I found confusing about coroutines when I first started with the <code>asyncio</code> library:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> syntax.</li>
<li>How you run a coroutine.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>async</code> tells the interpreter that you are writing a coroutine function and not a regular function.</li>
<li><code>await</code> is part of your coroutine instructions that basically says "I will be waiting for a response (Future)
here, so this is a good time to give someone else control if they have instructions they need to process"</li>
</ul>
<h4>Running a coroutine</h4>
<p>If you call a coroutine function like you do a normal function, you are going to be disappointed. Instead of
executing the instructions, calling a coroutine returns to you a coroutine object. This object is what's used
to create tasks so that the coroutine can be run in an event loop.</p>

<p>Now let's call the function and coroutine function:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>So how do we actually get a coroutine to run?  You need an event loop, and you need to wrap the coroutine
in a task to be run in the event loop. In my examples, <code>asyncio</code> handles the event loop generation and
task generation in the background EXCEPT for the <code>asyncio.create_task</code> coroutine. In that case, you need
to make sure you are calling that function with an event loop already running. I will handle manual task
creation in another post, however.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>asyncio.run()</code>. For example: <code>asyncio.run(my_couroutine(4))</code></li>
<li>You can <code>await</code> a coroutine within another coroutine. In the example above, <code>asyncio.sleep</code> is another
coroutine.</li>
<li>Create a task directly with the coroutine with <code>asyncio.create_task()</code>. For example:
<code>my_task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine(4))</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if you have a couple thousand URLs that you want to query at the same time? If you have all those URLs
handy, you may want to <strong>gather</strong> them up and <strong>dump</strong> them all into the event loop at the same time.
In order to do this, you could use the <code>asyncio.gather()</code> coroutine.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In <code>get_all_urls</code> for this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>We create a coroutine for each URL that is to be queried.</li>
<li>We gather all those coroutines, they're made into tasks (done in the background of <code>asyncio.gather</code>),
and then they are dumped into the event loop... again behind the scenes.</li>
<li>Once we get the response back from all the tasks we just gathered / dumped into the event loop, we return
the list of those values.</li>
</ol>
<h3>You need an entry point</h3>
<p>As of Python 3.7, you can use <code>asyncio.run()</code> as your entry point into your concurrency
programming.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your coroutines.</li>
<li>Write a coroutine called <code>main</code> that will serve as your first coroutine that will await
or gather any other coroutines that need to run.</li>
<li>Run the first or 'main' coroutine of your program by calling it via <code>asyncio.run(main())</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When you call <code>asyncio.run()</code>, it automatically handles setting up an event loop and wraps your
<code>main</code> coroutine into a task. When completed, <code>asyncio.run()</code> will automatically close the
event loop.</p>
<p>If you need to add tasks to the event loop throughout your code, that's fine. Design it in a
way that it all happens within your <code>main()</code> coroutine or in child coroutines.</p>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>I hope that by reading this post you have a better understanding of how to 'think' about using the
<code>asyncio</code> library. It really helps with heavy I/O bound scripts or programs. In future posts,
I plan to dive a little deeper into event loops, tasks, and futures as they're happening in the background.
This type of knowledge is handy for more complex programs and if you're using older versions of Python3.</p>
